# VotingMachine
This project is for voting. Poll.java is the more advanced one, since it has a window in which th users can vote for one of the candidates. There is the number of votes for each of the candidates as well as a pie chart to make the data easier to read. Poll.java contains the main method and shows the results of the voting. PollControlPanel.java controls the display of the window in Poll.java. PollDisplayPanel.java holds the vote counts and displays the numbers and the pie chart for the current vote counts.
